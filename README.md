# OSN-research
some research on OSN based on the course Crowd Science
## T1 
T1 is a easy task, we just need to calculate the clustering coefficient and neighborhood overlap.
Both clustering coefficient and neighborhood overlap are basic character of OSN.

## T2
We use two dataset on the website of Stanford Large Network Dataset to proof the <b>friendship paradox.</b>
Amazingly, more than 80% nodes satisfy the paradox compared to 50% nodes of random networks.
## T3

Stability of polarized networks. 

## T4

Simulate Diffusion Phenomena.

## T5

Simulate some voting algorithms, especially the middle term theorem.
